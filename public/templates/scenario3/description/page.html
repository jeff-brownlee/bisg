<p>Jane is joined in an elevator by one of George’s peers, Alfredo. Jane shows him an updated widget, saved just moments ago at her desk.  As they exit the elevator, Jane shares the widget with Alfredo by swiping it towards his smartphone while in share mode. Due to their proximity, the devices recognize each other and prompt confirmation. The widget then drops into Alfredo’s dashboard, ready for use.</p>
