  <li><span><strong>Contextual Model</strong> â€“ Moving beyond the traditional static navbar, the NextGen  interface provides functionality for each module within the context of that  specific module. This eliminates the complicated hierarchy and bloated menu  system which results from accommodating the entire feature set. Controls are  instead listed in small menus tailored to the active object, incorporating  other factors such as role entitlements, device and analytical user data.</span></li>
  <li><span><strong>Whitespace Between  Elements</strong>&nbsp;- Visual complexity is  reduced by using more space between elements, allowing discreet identity within  the interface. Groups are organized on panels with clear margins to separate  them from other elements.</span></li>
