    <ul>
      <li>Google  Generation: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a library, I have Google&rsquo;s search box&rdquo;</li>
      <li>First  Digital Generation: &ldquo;First Generation to be born into a fully digital world&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Generation  We: &ldquo;Inclusivity &amp; Multiculturalism&rdquo; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Their tolerance for poorly  implemented information design is very low. They expect a higher level of  complexity as a by-product of greater power and control over results. Millennials may be the early trend setters but all users are now expecting more. Users:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Receive  information quickly from multiple multimedia sources</li>
      <li>Process  pictures, sounds, color and video before text</li>
      <li>Prefer instant  gratification and sophisticated understanding of delayed rewards</li>
      <li>Expect immediate access to hyperlinked multimedia information</li>
      <li>Network  simultaneously with many others of various back- grounds and locations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Their world is fully connected,  social &amp; collaborative.  The tools  will eventually match their thinking.<br />
