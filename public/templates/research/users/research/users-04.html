<p>Millennials are already gathering  data from multiple sources and managing complexity in a far more efficient way  than previous generations. They are looking for new tools that are less  directional and allow for great peer-sharing and collaboration. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Attention has been given to the need to develop for mobile       first but consideration should be given to what happens after the paradigm       is established and mobile becomes ubiquitous. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

    <li><em>Data  optimization should happen regardless of the device - soon, tablets, phablets,  smart TVs and even home appliances will blur the line between device mobility  and user-intent. A phone won&rsquo;t mean multi-tasking, on-the-go and distracted. A  tablet won&rsquo;t mean, companion device, surfing to supplement desktop tasks. </em></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Data will need to be optimized not to device, but to       user-chosen intent. Every tier, from simple to complex will need to be       though-out on all devices to support this integration and collaboration,       which will be leverage through NFC technology.Â  </li>
