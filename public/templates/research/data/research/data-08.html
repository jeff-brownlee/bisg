<p>Where do you go from here? Data  will embark on a journey towards becoming fully accessible, customizable,  shareable and searchable. To get there, a look inward is required.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify all  data sources that are relevant to the enterprise: Often times, there are data  silos that are valuable to the organization, but exist in the form of a huge  Excel Spreadsheet managed by a lone resource and department. Sometimes data  from a separate vendor&rsquo;s database is pulled in manually, to the knowledge of  very few people.  Identify and map your  enterprises data-map.</li>
  <li>Consolidate  the data into one stream: Consolidation of data so that it can all be viewed as  one stream requires the creation of a global enterprise lexicon.  Often referred to as metadata, Tim Berners  Lee is pushing for the same kind of data identification and categorization in  the Semantic Web movement.</li>
  <li>Open your data points in key places: All too often, your vendors and internal stakeholders are unknowingly creating new data silos and isolating them from the rest of the enterprise.  Make data shareable across the enterprise, and create portals where external data can be integrated.</li>
