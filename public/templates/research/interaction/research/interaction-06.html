<p>Interaction will be driven by user preferences.  Users will be able to interact with data at any time, any place and any surface. How do we get there? </p>

  <li>Explore direct interaction with data visualizations: All too often, data visualizations are relegated to a ‘report’ stage of the analytical process.  There no longer is a need for reports to be static, just as there is no longer a need to accept the divide between the data and the visual representation.</li>
