<p><strong>Top 5 Tips</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li>Eliminate these phrases: “Tell us what you think” and “We want to hear from you”</li>
  <li>Write in 1st person. People talk to people. The us is a clear sign that this is an organization that won’t pay attention to your response.</li>
  <li>Lead with the question, not the content. e.g. What do you think about {x}? I've been considering {y} or {x} for some time. I noticed recently that {x} now has {something}. Does anyone know much about this?</li>
  <li>Engage first, tell second. If you would like convey information in this way, then ask people what they think about it first. Then when they reply you can respond with more information weave into your own thoughts.</li>
  <li>Ask specific people in the community to reply. Pick out popular community members and ask them to reply first. e.g. "I would love to hear what Mike or Joanna think about this"</li>
</ul>
