  <li><span><strong>Panel/Grid Lists  Replace Scrolling Lists</strong>&nbsp;- The NextGen  interface shows more information, using grid alignment instead of text  scrolling lists. This allows for quick scanning of data sets without the need for  multiple clicks through scrolling text lists to access details.</span></li>
  <li><span><strong>Sticky Interface  Elements</strong>&nbsp;â€“ Leveraging human&rsquo;s innate  ability to pathfind, sticky lists help the user retrieve information. Sticky  lists are persistent elements (such as docks, dragable items, and containers),  created by the user or automatically built by the system as it learns use  patterns. These items can be filled with content and remain where the user last  put them, setting up reliable expectation for subsequent uses.</span></li>
